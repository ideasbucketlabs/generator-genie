## Introduction

Generator Genie is a versatile, language-agnostic tool for creating project templates. It operates swiftly without the need for any server-side components. It empowers developers to initiate their projects swiftly, eliminating concerns about the cumbersome boilerplate setup. Additionally, it offers a visual preview of the template content, enabling users to review the materials before generating them.

The objective of Generator Genie is not merely to replace the existing array of project template generators (although in certain instances, it undoubtedly has the capability to do so). Instead, its purpose is to furnish a tool or method that can be harnessed to create organization/project-specific generators tailored to precise requirements.

Generator Genie's visual aesthetics draw inspiration from Spring Initializr, yet its underlying functionality operates in a distinctly unique manner. Unlike Spring Initializr, Generator Genie employs [LiquidJS Templates](https://liquidjs.com/index.html) for file generation. Because these templates are text-based and not bound to any particular programming language, they can be utilized to produce a diverse range of content according to specific requirements.

Currently, it facilitates project generation for Spring Boot and Vue.js, with the potential for more additions in the future. However, as previously stated, the primary aim of Generator Genie is not to encompass template generation for every conceivable project. Instead, its focus is on equipping users with the tools to facilitate such support when needed.
